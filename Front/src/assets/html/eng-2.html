<p><span class="keyword">Pitch</span> is the highness or lowness of a note. There are seven different <span class="repeat">pitches</span>, from A to G.</p>

<p>As we mentioned earlier, notes are read differently based on the <span class="repeat">clef</span>.</p>
<p>
        Aside from the notes we specified above, you can move up and down the <span class="repeat">staff</span> to change the <span class="repeat">pitch</span> of the note. Once you go beyond the five lines, you should start adding more lines to notate
        the <span class="repeat">pitch</span> (just like the low C in the <span class="repeat">treble clef</span> or the high C in the <span class="repeat">bass clef</span>).
</p>
<p><span class="keyword">Accidentals</span> are placed to the left of notes and also change the <span class="repeat">pitch</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="keyword">flat</span> (<span class="keyword">â™­</span>) lowers the original <span class="repeat">pitch</span> by a <span class="repeat">half-step</span>, and the <span class="keyword">sharp</span> (<span class="keyword">#</span>) raises
        it by a <span class="repeat">half-step</span>.</p>
<p><span class="repeat">Steps</span> will be further explained in Step 5: Scale.</p>
