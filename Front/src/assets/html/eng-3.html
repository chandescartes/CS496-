<p><span class="keyword">Duration</span> is how long the note is held for. Here are the five most common ones:</p>
<p class="list">A <span class="keyword">quarter note</span> is one beat.</p>
<p class="list">A <span class="keyword">half note</span> is two beats, equivalent to two <span class="repeat">quarter notes</span>.</p>
<p class="list">A <span class="keyword">whole note</span> is four beats, equivalent to four <span class="repeat">quarter notes</span>.</p>
<p class="list">An <span class="keyword">Eighth note</span> is half of a <span class="repeat">quarter note</span>.</p>
<p class="list">A <span class="keyword">sixteenth note</span> is half of an <span class="repeat">eighth note</span>.</p>

<p>As you can see, adding a flag halves the <span class="repeat">duration</span>. You can keep adding flags to shorten the note.</p>
<p><span class="keyword">Rests</span> are also important in music. The chart shows us how to notate <span class="repeat">rests</span> in various durations.</p>
<p>Consecutive flags can be joined to create beams: </p>

<p>A <span class="keyword">dot</span> next to a note adds another half of that note's <span class="repeat">duration</span> to it:</p>

<p>You can also tie notes together to extend notes:</p>
