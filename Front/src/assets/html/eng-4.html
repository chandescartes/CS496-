        You may have seen vertical lines separating notes into little boxes. These boxes are called measures. Each measure has the same number of beats, specified by the piece's time signature at the beginning of a line.

        The following piece has a 4/4 time signature. This means that there are four beats in every measure, and that every quarter note gets one beat.
