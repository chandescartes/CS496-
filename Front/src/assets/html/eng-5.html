        Scales is a sequence of eight notes following a pattern. While there are many types of scales, we will look at the major scale for now. The major scale consists of the following pattern:
</p>
<p class="pattern">
        Whole - Whole - Half - Whole - Whole - Whole - Half
</p>
<p>
        What does this mean? You can think of a half-step as the distance between two consecutive notes on a piano (including the black keys), and a whole-step as two half-steps.

        Now let's look at the D major scale. Check for yourself that the D major scale follows this pattern:

        When we are playing a piece in D major, we are likely to play notes that are a part the scale. However, putting a sharp next to every F and C in the piece would be a nightmare for both the composer and the player! Therefore, we specify the key signature
        after the clef.

        Now, every following F and C will be played as F# and C#, respectively.
