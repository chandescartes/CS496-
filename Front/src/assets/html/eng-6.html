        We learned the duration of individual notes, but how do you know how long to hold a beat? Tempo tells us this.</p>
<p>
        We can use beats per minute (BPM), but we can also specify a range of BPM to give some freedom to the player.
</p>
<p>
        For example, in this excerpt from Mozart's piano sonata, the left part is marked as Allegro, or about 144 quarter notes per minute, and the right part is marked as Adagio, or about 60 eighth notes per minute.

<p>These are some commonly used tempo markings, and some sample pieces to give you a feeling of each.</p>

        Changes in tempo can be notated anywhere in the music as well. For example, <span class="italian">ritardando</span>, or <span class="italian">rit.</span>, means to slow down gradually, whereas <span class="italian">accelerando</span>, or
        <span class="italian">accel.</span>, means to speed up gradually.
