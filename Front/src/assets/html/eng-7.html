        We can play the same note softly or loudly and it will sound entirely different. Dynamics is how loud or quiet the sound is.</p>
<p>Here are some common dynamic levels:</p>
<table class="table">
        <thead>
                <tr class="italian">
                        <th>pp</th>
                        <th>p</th>
                        <th>mp</th>
                        <th>mf</th>
                        <th>f</th>
                        <th>ff</th>
                </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
                <tr>
                        <td>very soft</td>
                        <td>soft</td>
                        <td>medium soft</td>
                        <td>medium loud</td>
                        <td>loud</td>
                        <td>very loud</td>
                </tr>
        </tbody>
</table>
<p>
        Changes in dynamics can also be marked anywhere in the music. For example, <span class="italian">crescendo</span>, or <span class="italian">cresc.</span>, means to get gradually louder, whereas <span class="italian">diminuendo</span>, or
        <span class="italian">dim.</span>, means to get gradually softer.
</p>
<p>
        Emphasis on individual notes is placed with an accent or the <span class="italian">sforzando</span> (<span class="italian">sf.</span>) mark. This note should be played significantly more strongly than others.
