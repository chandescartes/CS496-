<p>Here are some other musical notations you should be aware of.</p>
<p>
        The repeat sign indicates a part that should be repeated. You should repeat from the opening repeat sign, or, if there is none, from the beginning. Here is a case without an opening repeat sign.

        The octave higher (<span class="italian">8<sup>va</sup></span>) sign indicates to play this part an octave higher than notated. Similarly, the octave lower (<span class="italian">8<sup>vb</sup></span>) sign tells us to play an octave lower.

        Often times, you will see notes under a curved line. This means to play them <span class="italian">legato</span>, or smoothly and connectedly.

        On the other hand, <span class="italian">staccato</span>, marked with dots on the ends of the notes, tells us to play the note short and apart.
